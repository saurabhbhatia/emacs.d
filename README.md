## emacs.d
In the last 2 years, I've used Sublime Text 3, Atom, VS Code and MacVim. I normally switch between Vim and Emacs depending upon the day. I have heavily customized my emacs config. This is just a reference to all the customization I've done.

This file is my local emacs config. I use emacs as my editor for Ruby, rails, golang, react js, jsx and vue js projects. 

* Default font - monaco, size : 13 - [Monaco font](http://www.fontpalace.com/font-download/Monaco/)
* Default theme - Doom Molokai by [Emacs Doom themes](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes)
